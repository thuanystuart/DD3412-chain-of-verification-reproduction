In the process, she causes one of the worst local disasters the town has ever had. King has commented that he finds the work to be \"raw\" and \"with a surprising power to hurt and horrify.\" Much of the book uses newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books to tell how Carrie destroyed the fictional town of Chamberlain, Maine while exacting revenge on her sadistic classmates and her own mother, Margaret.

This small act of solidarity has unforeseen consequences, impacting the children, their parents and the school board.

At Edgar's, the students listen to the radio station RIAS, broadcasting from West Berlin.

Kurt manages to convince the majority of the class to hold a moment of silence for the victims in Hungary before class starts.

One evening, Roger informs Ginny that he witnessed one of her girls, Tina, assumed to have run away, being lured into the back of a distinct green van. Ginny dismisses the claim as paranoia.\n\n\nIt is revealed that the van belongs to Nicolette Aster, the safety inspector at Fresh Kills Landfill.

The main character, Gesine Cresspahl, is a German single mother in Manhattan, and we follow her life from childhood in 1930s rural Eastern Germany at the time of the rise of Nazism, through World War II, the Soviet occupation zone, establishment of the GDR, and beginning of the Cold War, followed by her exile to New York. Eventually, she decides to return to Europe, and leaves for Prague, unaware that Soviet tanks have occupied the city and put down the Prague Spring. The novel has 367 short sections, one for each day of the year, from 21 August 1967 to 21 August 1968 (a leap year) plus a prelude section in the first volume and an appendix to the second, though it bears very little resemblance to a series of diary entries. The narrative moves between past and present, and often shifts rapidly from first- to third-person. Most sections incorporate news reports, as Gesine reads them in the ''New York Times'' each day on the subway."}], "Momo (novel)": [{"novels by Michael Ende": "'''''Momo''''', also known as '''''The Grey Gentlemen''''' or '''''The Men in Grey''''', is a fantasy novel by Michael Ende, published in 1973.", "1973 German novels": "'''''Momo''''', also known as '''''The Grey Gentlemen''''' or '''''The Men in Grey''''', is a fantasy novel by Michael Ende, published in 1973.
